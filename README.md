# Oversampler
Kind of like a Ditherer, but not really

## What is it?
Well, technically it IS a Ditherer, but I had no idea what dithering meant nor had I any idea such concept existed at the time of implementation so, there you have it, **Oversampler**.

I also had fun stepping out of my confort zone regarding coding conventions breaking every single one I could fine withing a 12 mile radius **especially** PEP 8.
